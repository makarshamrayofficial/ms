<center><i><h3>Makar Shamray is a 19-year-old electronic artist and producer born in Mariupol. His music blends raw emotional intensity with experimental electronic sound design, shaping a style that moves between hardcore, alternative electronic, and post-punk-inspired atmospheres. Known for his dark tones, distorted rhythms, and cinematic textures, Makar creates tracks that feel both personal and brutally honest.

Growing up between chaos and reconstruction, he channels real experiences into his sound—melodies that echo Eastern European coldness and beats that push against the limits of underground electronic music. Starting independently, he released his early work on platforms such as SoundCloud, Apple Music, and Spotify, where his evolving catalog showcases his drive to experiment and redefine himself with every project.

On Spotify, Makar has released notable works including the album 2000 and singles like прощай, я умираю, ssscrumptious_jumpstyle, and meaningless, exploring everything from heavy electronic pressure to nostalgic, melancholic soundscapes. His visual and musical style often draws inspiration from post-Soviet architecture, isolation, and the darker corners of youth culture.

With every release, Makar Shamray grows deeper into a world of intense emotion and bold production choices—an artist forging a unique voice in the modern electronic scene, one that resonates with listeners looking for something darker, louder, and real. </center></i></h3>
